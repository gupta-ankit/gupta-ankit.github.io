1. Remove categories from the post; only keep tags. The categories tag is a remnant of the export from WP to Jekyll. The separation between category and tag is not required for a blog of this scale.
2. Create a footer to include a search box, link to RSS feed, and any other social links like Github, Stackoverflow etc.
3. Research and implement how to allow google search to show different sections of the website when someone searches for it.
4. Complete the research section
5. Paginate the posts on the home page.
6. Fix pagination so that the first para is displayed (OR) iteratively add the intro section for the posts (word/character count based pagination is not looking pretty)
7. Fix the font for the post titles and content to be in harmony with the header font
8.  Fix the display of tags. For example on this page http://ankit-gupta.com/uncategorized/2017/09/14/replacing-dual-boot-with-bash-on-windows.html, the tags look weird and the multi-word tag (bash on windows) is broken. The tags must be hyperlinks.
