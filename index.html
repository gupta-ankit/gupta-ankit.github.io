        I am a research assistant at Simon Fraser University. Before joining as a research assistant I completed by M.Sc. (Computing Science) from <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Fraser University</a> and B.E. (Computer Science and Engineering) from  <a href="http://www.iet.dauniv.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IET-DAVV</a>.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.

        In addition, I am also a professional software developer. Although I develop primarily in Java, I develop in couple other languages such as Processing (which is kind-of Java) and Ruby on Rails. Occasionally, I also write code for the web (HTML5 + JS + CSS).

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In my free time, I like to play around Java frameworks and libraries (mostly for fun), write blog posts and read stuff.
