      <p><strong>Hi there! Welcome to my website</strong></p>
      <p>
         My name is Ankit Gupta and I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html">School of Interactive Arts &amp; Technology</a> at the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>. Here I work under the supervision of Dr. Shaw to investigate how Information Technology can be used to help people in improving their health.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently working on the research and development of two healthcare applications &mdash; <a href="https://fitviz.iat.sfu.ca/fitvizapp-dev/users/sign_in">FitViz</a> and <a href="https://www.swapp.iat.sfu.ca/users/sign_in">SWAPP</a>. FitViz is developed to help arthritis patients in maintaining a physically active lifestyle. SWAPP, on the other hand, is designed to help caregivers and doctors of children with sleep disorders.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my research, I also work as a freelance software developer and consultant. I have over 5 years of experience in developing web and desktop applications using Ruby on Rails, Java, and PHP (including Wordpress).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are interested in my research or need help with software development, feel free to write me an <a href="mailto:ankit.gupta2801@gmail.com">email</a> and I will get back to you asap.
