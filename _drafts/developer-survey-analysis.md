Some time ago StackOverflow released the results of the 2021 Developer Survey. One of the things that I was interested in was how the Ruby community is doing (at least the one on StackOverflow).

And, the results were interesting. Compared to previous year, Ruby is still the 17th most commonly used programming languages, with a slight decrease in the percentage of respondets who use Ruby (6.05% vs 6.75%). Also, similar to last year around 50% of those who use Ruby
love it, and the other half hate it (a programming language is deemed as dreaded/hated by a respondent if the list of languages that they want to use does not include the language they are currently using). That means that if a respondent mentioned Ruby as one of the languages
that they used last year, but the list of languages that they want to use does not include Ruby, that is inferred as the respondent not liking Ruby.

Among those who are full-time software developers:
1. What languages interest those who no longer love Ruby?
2. What languages are potential Rubyists using?
3. Where are the users of languages that Rubyists want to explore headed?
