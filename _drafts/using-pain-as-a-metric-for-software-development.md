title: Using pain as a metric for software development
---

If I remember correctly, the idea of "Pain Driven Development" was first introduced to me a couple of years ago by Kent Beck. 
The idea is quite simple, "You fix something, only if it hurts," or conversely, "Do not fix something that does not hurt." I 
started using this as a guiding principle on my projects almost as soon as I first heard about it. And, I must say, the 
experience has been immensely rewarding. While working on a moderately complex codebase, there will inevitably be times when 
you will feel "pain" when trying to complete a task; you know that you are in pain often when something that you expect to be 
straightforward, well, is not. The most common step (based on my observations) that developers usually take when experiencing 
pain is to ignore it (or worse, create a ticket in the backlog). I think this happens, because If you are following this 
principle, Why is it important to be aware of the pain? Pain is an early warning signal, warning you of the dangers that lie 
ahead if you continue on the same course. Please do not ignore it! It is going to get worse over time, and it will get harder 
to fix. PDD at the workplace PDD can be quite useful for an organization, especially if you are a startup. If you are in a 
leadership position at your workplace, and you would like to promote PDD, you will have to support it. Here are some things 
that you will have to promote Not tying the performance of a developer to the number of tickets or story points that they 
complete. Promoting a culture where your dev team has the opportunity to surface their pain (perhaps during Spring retros)
Promoting a culture where it is okay to share the pain. The team member should not feel that they will be made fun of for sharing their pain. Of course, you do not have to fix every problem right away. That might not even be possible.
